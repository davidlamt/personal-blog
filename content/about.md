## Introduction

![David's Portrait](../images/david.png)

Hi!

...

Well, this is awkward. I didn't think anyone would actually visit my about page. ​I suppose I should provide what you are here for, right?

Since you are on this page, I assume that you know my name (my name is David Tran). I have quite a sarcastic personality that does not translate well for me sometimes, especially in writing where it is difficult to interpret. I apologize for any sarcastic remarks that offend you. Now that I have given myself a free pass to irritate you without consequences, lets get on with the show!

## Background

I graduated from the University of California, Irvine in 2016 after suffering through four years in the Computer Engineering major. Beyond the misery of academics, I was able to find solace in the great relationships that flourished.

During my time in college, I was able to find several internships in the web development industry to develop and hone my skills. I was somehow able to defeat the tenacious monster known as Catch-22 (a job requiring experience that can only be obtained by having a job - "2 years experience in X"). I was fortunate enough to have a full-time position lined up for after graduation.

I am currently enjoying my career as a software developer in a company that manufactures payment devices and terminals. My day-to-day consists me staring at a computer screen for 8 hours, wondering why things do not work, and then going home to cry myself to sleep. Honestly, despite the definite frustrations, I find my work to be very rewarding!

## Interests

In my free time, I enjoy dabbling in new technologies, traveling, reading, and recently, creating online businesses. My weapon of choice is JavaScript and I wield it, clumsily, to slay colossal demons (i.e., problems I think are difficult but are really not). I have a huge interest in the world of bits (yes, the 1's and 0's) although I am not an expert in that field.

## More Information

If you would like to see my past and current software projects, feel free to visit my personal portfolio at [https://dav﻿﻿﻿idtranscend.com](https://davidtranscend.com).

Wow, ​you actually read the entire about page? Someone must be interested in me :). If you would like to see me stumble through life as a software developer, you can read some of my most recent posts on the [hom﻿﻿e](/) page.
