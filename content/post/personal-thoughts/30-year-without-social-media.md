How often do you open social media applications without realizing it?

Here is a little experiment: take note of every time you habitually open a social media platform in a day.

If you are like a majority of people, you will be surprised that the number is much higher than what you would think.

I struggled with what you can call "social media addiction". It was damaging my relationships with others, twisting my perceptions, and also wasting my precious time.

About a year ago, after someone finally pointed it out, I decided to go cold turkey with social media.

## Get Your Priorities Straight

Before the intervention, social media was my #1 priority.

Of course, I did not think that or would ever agree to that statement. However, **my actions proved otherwise**.

When hanging out with others, I would constantly be glued to my phone because the number of likes I was getting on a post was obviously more important than the "conversation" I was having.

Social media was a distraction for me.

### Awkwardness Avoidance

Another aspect I now despise is the fact that I used social media to avoid "awkward" situations. For instance, I would instinctively pull out my phone to scroll through my Instagram feed if conversations died down.

In retrospect, I could have continued the interaction if I chose but I used social media as a clutch. How many deep and thought-provoking ideas have not been silenced because of my addiction?

### Where Has My Time Gone?

How often do we wish that we had more time in a day to tackle more tasks?

Well, I would have accomplished more of my goals if I had not been sitting in my chair, scrolling through Facebook. I would have gained more out of my college education if I had not been looking at what others said on Twitter and actually paid attention to lectures.

How about getting more sleep instead of going through my Snapchat feed? Maybe I would have stayed awake during class and avoided using social media to keep my eyes open. What a vicious cycle. üôÅ
