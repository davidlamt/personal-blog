I have recently added an [archives page](/archives) to my blog.

I wanted visitors to be able to find posts on my blog more easily. I found myself looking for more posts when visiting other blogs, especially if I enjoyed the entry post.

Before this addition, my previous content could only be accessed by moving through pages. I have the pagination setting set to show only five posts per page.

My blog does contain categories (check out the menu) but the category pages are still limited to five posts per page.

Of course, I can increase the pagination limit but I do not want to clutter each page with numerous posts. Furthermore, increasing the number of posts per page would increase the load time.
