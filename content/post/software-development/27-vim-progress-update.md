I began my Vim journey a [while back](/using-vim-for-a-week).

I am not using Vim at the time of writing this post.

Okay, now that all the Vim purists have left...

I am still using Vim key bindings because they are *freaking amazing*.

Also, I was kidding earlier. I have nothing against people who use Vim in a pure manner! On the contrary, I think that they are awesome and I bet they are much more productive than I can ever hope to be.

Anyhow, I hope that you will continue on with this post and interpret my thoughts with an open mind regardless of your opinions on Vim.

Let's not have a lynching today, okay? ðŸ™‚

## Vim Integration

I said that I am not currently using Vim but rather just Vim key bindings. What the heck does that mean anyways?
