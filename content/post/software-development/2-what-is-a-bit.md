I recently discovered that bit is actually an abbreviation for **binary digit**. But that does not really answer the question of what is a bit, does it? First and foremost, binary refers to a system that is composed of or involves two elements. Therefore, we can deduce that a binary digit (bit) is a digit that can contain one of two states. This is an abstract and crude interpretation but I believe it explains the concept, in words, quite well.

I like to think that a bit is analogous to an electron. Both a bit and the fundamental particle are of the smallest caliber in their respective worlds of computing and physics (let's not get into a debate about quantum computing and quarks, okay?).

An individual bit can have either a value of **1 or 0**. While â€‹these two values are fixed, **the information they describe can vary**. For instance, a bit can represent:

- True or false
- On or off
- Positive voltage or 0 voltage

| **Binary Digit (bit)** | **Example Representations** |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 0                      | False, off, no voltage      |
| 1                      | True, on, some voltage      |
