I recently had the opportunity to attend <a href="http://www.kconusa.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KCON</a> with my girlfriend and her friend.

This was my first time attending KCON. I used to listen to a lot of K-pop when I was younger but not as much anymore. I actually have a Korean music playlist on Spotify that I listen to once in a while.

This is all to say that I enjoy Korean music even though I do not understand it. **You do not have to understand something to appreciate it**.
